# tic-tac-toe
The file "ttt2.c" is the implementation of a naive tic-tac-toe program (version 2. Version 1 was not uploaded to GitHub) written in C, which consists of two basic features:

1. The game board.
By not typing in "m", you will be able to call the two-person gameboard, which will be able to stop whenever the current situation is the end of the game, judging who wins, and respond while there is a tie. You are to input the position of the place in the positive integer given on the upper left corner of each position (1-9).

2. The AI system.
There is a single-player system embedded, which allows the user to play with the machine, who should not lose in theory. Enter "m" when you are asked to in order to activate this feature. The input method is the same as above.

It is able to check input validity from version 2.2.

Any potential amendments are appreciated, contact me at bzy20010519@hotmail.com . You are advised to call me "BAI" which is easier to type (and was used most often by my friends).
