# tic-tac-toe
The file ttt2 is the implementation of a naive tic-tac-toe program written in C, which consists of two basic features:

1. The game board.
By not typing in "m", you will be able to call the two-person gameboard, which will be able to stop whenever the current situation is the end of the game, judging who wins, and respond while there is a tie.

2. The AI system
There is a single-player system embedded, which allows the user to play with the machine, who should not lose in theory. Enter "m" when you are asked to in order to activate this feature.
